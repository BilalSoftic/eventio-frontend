# React Native Expo Project README

## Project Prerequisites
Before starting the React Native Expo project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- An Android/iOS phone or an emulator/simulator with Expo Go installed

### Installing Node.js and npm
1. **Node.js**: Visit the [Node.js website](https:/ 
/nodejs.org/) and download the latest stable version for your operating system.
2. **npm**: npm is bundled with Node.js. Once you have installed Node.js, npm will be automatically installed on your machine.

## Getting Started
To start the React Native Expo project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the Expo development server by running the command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. The Expo Developer Tools interface will open in the terminal. You will see a QR code and a list of options.

6. To run the app on an **emulator** or **simulator**:

   - **Android emulator**: In the Expo Developer Tools interface, press `a` to open the app in the connected Android emulator.
   
   - **iOS simulator**: In the Expo Developer Tools interface, press `i` to open the app in the connected iOS simulator.

   > Note: Make sure you have set up the emulator or simulator beforehand.

7. To run the app on a **physical device**:

   - On your Android/iOS phone, open the Expo Go app.

   - Tap the "Scan QR Code" option in the Expo Go app.

   - Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal using your phone's camera. This will open the app on your phone.

8. You should now see your React Native Expo project running on the emulator/simulator or physical device.
